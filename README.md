# iCalculator

JavaScript mock iOS Calculator. This is a portfolio project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/calculator) coursework.

## Features/Pride Points

This project provides basic parenthases functionality paired with input display, a combination I miss in the iOS version.

- UI is CSS only (no images or SVGs)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Numberpad functionality
- Outputs scientific notation for very large and small numbers
- Handles comma display
- Limits input and display to 9 digits
- Single character deletion

This project uses [interact.js](https://interactjs.io).

## Items to clean up:

- 0 return value displays as scientific notation
- percent functionality is a bit wonky smaller than 4 decimal places
- percent function allows number and decimal input after the fact
